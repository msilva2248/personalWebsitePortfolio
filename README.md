# personalWebsitePortfolio
This project involves the creation of a Fullstack Web Application from scratch.

For the frontend portion of this application, I utilize React JS, HTML5, CSS3, VS Code, Bootstrap, Axios and JSX to create and design the website as well as extract the data from the backend via API requests.

For the backend portion of this application, I utilize Spring Boot, Node JS, Java 17, Maven, MySQL, IntelliJ, and Postman to create the database schema, insert values into the tables, connect to MySQL db/create the end-to-end connection and return the requested data for extraction from the frontend side.
