# personalWebsitePortfolio
This project involves the creation of a Fullstack Web Application from scratch.

For the frontend portion of this application, I utilize React JS, HTML5, CSS3, VS Code, Bootstrap, Axios and JSX to create and design the website as well as extract the data from the backend via API requests. The frontend is deployed to AWS S3.

For the backend portion of this application, I utilize Spring Boot, Node JS, Java 17, Maven, MySQL, IntelliJ, and Postman to create the database schema, insert values into the tables, connect to MySQL db/create the end-to-end connection and return the requested data for extraction from the frontend side.

The website is fully deployed to AWS where the database was created on RDS and the connection was made through MySQL Workbench and the application properties on the backend application. I utilized AWS EC2 to create an instance in the cloud where I could deploy the backend spring boot application that handles the models and controllers to each table in the database. Lastly, I utilized AWS S3 to deploy my frontend react application and store it within a bucket which contains my objects (files) and any metadata describing the files.
